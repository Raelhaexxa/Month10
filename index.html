                        <p>
                            I've been meaning to tell you this for a long time now, that I am beyond grateful for being a part of my life.
                            There is no such thing that could replace you in my heart and that I am very lucky to have a person like you,
                            I love you so much that I don't know what words to use, It is that I really love you , I really do.

                            Thank you for making me happy after all these days, months and to the upcoming year that is yet to come,

                            Happy Monthsary My Love, I love you very much
